## About

Welcome to [SAAS](saas.berkeley.edu) and Data Foundations! Data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world; throughout the fall semester we'll be aiming to provide an experience that will define your understanding of this broad domain. We will build a comprehensive overview of the data science life cycle, with some other topics including Python, Pandas, EDA, Linear Regression, Paramateric vs Nonparametric Classification, Performance Metrics, Advanced Modeling, and more. We aim to prepare and engage you in the Data Mentorship and Data Consulting committees, and we hope you find this semester transformative in your understanding of data science. 

### Goals
Offer the support support and tools necessary to address real-world problems

Enable students to think critically as data scientists

Provide the necessary tools and techniques for the Data Mentorship and Data Consulting Committee

## Lecture

Lectures will be held in-person Wednesdays from 7-9 pm. Members will be presented through an interactive case study that will engage you in the class in various different ways. Note that the schedule is subject to change. Attending these lectures are mandatory. 

## Assignments

The main deliverables will be homework assignments and the final project. Homeworks will be due the following Wednesday which lecture was delivered, and the final project will be due the last week of lecture, November 15th.

### Grading Criteria

In short, there is none. Although we will not be giving you a final grade for your work in Data Foundations, we will be giving constructive feedback for your work so that you may reference in the future. Also note that although we're not explicitly administering grades, we expect continuous engagement with the material and completion of requisite assignments throughout the semester.

## Resources

### Device Lending Options
Students can access device lending options through the Student Technology Equity Program [STEP program](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/devicelending).

### Community Standards 
Beyond the quips that many of us make unintentionally are a host of behaviors that we do not tolerate. We must demonstrate appropriate respect, consideration, and compassion for others, inside and outside of the classroom. Please be friendly and thoughtful; our community draws from a wide spectrum of valuable experiences. As a member of SAAS and a student at Berkeley, we expect respect outlined by Berkeley's [Principles of Community](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community) and the [Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct](https://conduct.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct/)  

### Extenuating Circumstances
We recognize that our students come from varied backgrounds and have widely-varying experiences. We will be organizing this system on a case-by-case system, so if you encounter extenuating circumstances at any time in this semster, please do not hesitate to let the a person in leadership know (Nathan, Sakchhi, Carlos, anyone in exec). The sooner that we are made aware, the more options we have available to use to ensure your success in the committee.
